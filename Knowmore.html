        <h1>What Is Poverty?</h1>
        <p>The term poverty refers to the state or condition in which people or communities lack the financial resources and essentials for a minimum standard of living. As such, their basic human needs cannot be met. People and families who live in poverty may go without proper housing, clean water, healthy food, and medical attention. Each nation may have its own criteria for determining the poverty line and counting how many of its people live in poverty. Poverty is a socioeconomic condition that is the result of multiple factors—not just income. These factors include race, and little to no access to education, among others.</p>
        <br>
        <h1>Understanding Poverty</h1>
        <p>Poverty refers to the lack of adequate financial resources such that individuals, households, and entire communities don't have the means to subsist or acquire the basic necessities for a flourishing life. This means being so poor as to struggle to obtain food, clothing, shelter, and medicines.</p>
        <p>Poverty is both an individual concern as well as a broader social problem. On the individual or household level, not being able to make ends meet can lead to a range of physical and mental issues. At the societal level, high poverty rates can be a damper on economic growth and be associated with problems like crime, unemployment, urban decay, education, and poor health.</p>
        <p>Governments often put social welfare programs in place to help lift individuals, families, and communities out of poverty. Some countries have stronger welfare states (social safety nets) than others. For instance, the U.S. tends to be much more individualistic and shuns welfare programs. European countries, in comparison, have a much broader range of welfare programs and support for those in need.</p>
        <br>
        <h1>Global Poverty</h1>
        <p>Poverty has decreased in developed countries since the Industrial Revolution. Increased production reduced the cost of goods, making them more affordable, while advancements in agriculture increased crop yields, as well as food production.</p>
        <p>The international poverty line is a monetary threshold under which an individual is considered to be living in poverty. This figure is calculated by taking the poverty threshold from each country—given the value of the goods needed to sustain one adult—and converting it into U.S. dollars. The current international poverty line is $2.15 per day.
        </p>
        <p>Many people around the globe still struggle to make ends meet. According to the World Bank, an estimated 719 million people lived in extreme poverty—defined as surviving on less than the $2.15 per day line—by the end of 2020.</p>
        <p>It's estimated that more than 40% of the world's population lives in poverty, with the United States scoring the highest among developed nations. According to a report from Frontiers, communities of color are more susceptible to poverty because of "racist notions of racial inferiority and frequent denial of the structural forms of racism and classism" globally and within the U.S.</p>
        <p></p>
        <br>
        <h1>What Causes Poverty?</h1>
        <p>Poverty is a difficult cycle to break and often passes from one generation to the next. It is often determined by socioeconomic status, ethnicity, gender, and geography. Many people are born into poverty and have little hope of overcoming it. Others may fall into poverty because of negative economic conditions, natural disasters, or surging living costs, as well as drug addiction, depression, and mental health issues.

            Access to good schools, healthcare, electricity, clean drinking water, and other critical services remains elusive for many and is often determined by socioeconomic status, gender, ethnicity, and geography. Other root causes of poverty include:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Limited to no job growth</li>
            <li>Poor infrastructure</li>
            <li>Conflict and war</li>
            <li>High cost of living</li>
            <li>Social barriers</li>
            <li>Lack of government support</li>
        </ul>
        <p>For those able to move out of poverty, progress is often temporary. Economic shocks, food insecurity, and climate change threaten their gains and may force them back into poverty.

            Typical consequences of poverty include alcohol and substance abuse, little to no access to education, poor housing and living conditions, and increased levels of disease. Heightened poverty is likely to cause increased tensions in society as inequality increases. These issues often lead to rising crime rates in communities affected by poverty.</p>
        <h1>How Poverty Is Measured</h1>
        <p>Poverty is commonly measured using income thresholds in many countries, including the United States. Centralized bodies like the Census Bureau collect data and update the information on an annual basis based on inflation. This information, which is reported through the Consumer Price Index for All Urban Consumers (CPI-U), generally includes income thresholds compiled from different sizes and types of families/households. Each family member in a household that falls under the threshold is considered to be in poverty, according to the Census Bureau.</p>
        <p>Certain types of individuals are not included in the count as their level of poverty cannot be determined. These groups include:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>People within certain group settings like prisons and nursing homes            </li>
            <li>Individuals living in military barracks</li>
            <li>Those living in college dorms</li>
            <li>eople under the age of 15 whose income cannot be determined</li>
        </ul>
        <p>Keep in mind that using income thresholds is just one way that countries measure poverty. But there are other ways to determine who lives above and below the poverty line. Some countries may use an absolute figure like the one used by the World Bank. As noted above, the organization determined that people who live below the $2.15-per-day limit are in poverty.</p>
        <h1>How to Reduce Poverty</h1>
        <p>The United Nations and the World Bank are major advocates of reducing world poverty. The World Bank has an ambitious target of reducing poverty to less than 3% of the global population by 2030. Some of the actionable plans to eliminate poverty include the following:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Installing wells that provide access to clean drinking water            </li>
            <li>Educating farmers on how to produce more food</li>
            <li>Constructing shelter for those in need</li>
            <li>Building schools to educate disadvantaged communities</li>
            <li>Providing enhanced access to better healthcare services by building medical clinics and hospitals</li>

        </ul>
        <p>For poverty to be eradicated as the World Bank sets out to do, communities, governments, and corporations need to collaborate to implement strategies that improve living conditions for the world’s poor. Among these strategies may include boosting socioeconomic conditions, fighting and eliminating systemic racism, establishing minimum wages that align with the cost of living, providing paid leave, and promoting pay equity among other things.</p>
