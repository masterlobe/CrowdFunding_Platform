           <p>In a world of disparities and inequities, millions of individuals around the globe struggle to break free from the shackles of poverty. They face countless challenges - hunger, inadequate shelter, lack of education, and limited access to healthcare. But poverty is not just about statistics; it's about the dreams deferred, the potential untapped, and the futures that hang in the balance.

            At MakeItHappen, we believe in the power of collective action to change the course of lives. We understand that poverty is not an issue that can be resolved by a single act, but rather by a sustained effort that uplifts communities, fosters self-reliance, and opens doors to opportunities. That's why we've launched this crowdfunding campaign - to address poverty at its roots and make a lasting impact.       </p>
